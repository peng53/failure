README for hierarch_naive.tcl

hierarch_naive.tcl is a TCL script for manipulating a SQLITE database
with hierarchy/tree-like structure. Data is grouped under some parent
of whose removal will delete the children (grammar?). The data at
the moment happens to be URLS but it would be useful if I could find
some way of having another script define the table, while keeping the
metadata intact (group ids, etc).

This is an naive implementation. That is to say it looks like I'm making
a tree with two arrays which may lead to performance issue down the line
for certain procedures. Just getting all children of a root needs several
SQL statements.

Hopefully I'll make another implementation down the line, but this is just
the start-up needed to get some ground-work up.
