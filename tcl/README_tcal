README for tcal.tcl

tcal.tcl (shortened tcal) is a script in TCL that create a
Calendar widget that made of two buttons, a label, and a
canvas. The calendar itself is drawn on the canvas, the
label displays when month and year, and the buttons go back
or forward a month.

On: Bindings
There are also key-bindings when the canvas is focused:
	Control+(Left|Right Arrow) -> previous|next month
	Control+(Up|Down Arrow) -> previous|next year

	If there is a day selected (see selection):
		Left|Right Arrow -> move selection to left|right item;
			going to previous|next month if on the edge.
		Up|Down -> move selection to upper|lower item

Mouse bindings for the canvas include:
	Left Button (button 1) -> select a day
	Right Button (button 2) -> cancels selection(s)
	Shift + Left Button -> select a day or range-select
		from prior to current selection.

On: Selection
Selection is stored until replaced or cleared. Selection is
retrived by the $C.get_selected procedure. Given:
	no selection: returns empty string
	single selection: returns MONTH DAY YEAR
	range selection: returns MONTH1 DAY1 YEAR1 MONTH1 DAY2 YEAR2

Selections via Shift+Left Button work as follows:
	none selected: selects day
	single selected: expands selection range with prior selection.
	range selected depends:
		if new day is greater: expand future days
		if new day is lesser: shrink or expand left boundary

While only current month days are shown, it possible to make selections
spanning months, even years, by using Shift+Left Button.

On: Appearance/Init procedure
Aspects of the of calendar visuals that can be changed include:
	day of the week height (dowH)
	canvas font (font)
	day square width/height (SQ)
	positioning of day text (txtX,txtY)
These can be set via the Cal::CalVars procedure.
The CalVars proc take the following inputs in order:
	inital_month inital_year SQ txtX txtY font dowH

dowH and SQ's unit are in pixels
font is a TCL/TK accepted font string such as {Arial 10} or {bold}
txtX and txtY is number. It is used as a percent multiplier for positioning
depending on SQ. E.g. if SQ is 32 and txtX is 0.5, then the day will horizontally
be in the center, or 16. Note that nothing prevents values outside [0,1].
inital_month and inital_year set the day the calendar starts on. They are
1-indexed and range follows usual month/year ranges.

At the moment, tcal's colors are hardcoded and days are
squares. (may change later on)

On: Standalone
