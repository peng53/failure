"""
Random string generator of a certain format.

Just an idea ATM, put on hold until work on other stuff has ceased.

Not a ground breaking idea, just basic stuff using the google-heavy
''.join(a for a in string.x)

Not meant to beat any password generator.

After this is complete, I'll try for an easy GUI
Might collide with inc_test.py/rdata_gen.cpp later on
