README for dprod_ed (database productivity editor)

How to use:
Run dprod_ed in a terminal. Be sure your terminal is large enough
or the program will not continue.
Select new or load database. This will prompt for a filename. The
filename may also be an absolute or relative path.

	E.g. Relative in upper directory
	../file.db
	E.g. Absolute
	/home/user/file.db

If the file does not fit intended schema (or does not exist),
file loading will fail. It may also fail if file cannot be created.

In event of success, rows of the loaded database are displayed
ordered by rowid.

To manipulate the database, one may use the commands on the
lower part of the display. The key-bindings correspond to the
first letter of the command (lowercase).

The following commands are possible:
	INSERT (i)
		Creates a row to be added. An editor is opening for
		specifying the row's values. See Editor for specifics.

	EDIT (e)
		Edits an existing row. As expected, an editor is opened
		with that row's current values. See Editor for specifics.

	VIEW (v)
		Views an existing row. An editor is opened with that row's
		value, but editing is permited. Any input will hide this
		view.

	COPY
		Doesn't do anything. Will be removed/renamed.

	DELETE (d)
		Deletes current row. User will not be prompted for confirmation.
		This may change later on.

	SAVE (s)
		Saves changes to the database. Simple as that.

	CLOSE (c)
		Closes the database view and returns to the 'load/new/quit' screen.

	REFRESH (r)
		Calls for the program to redraw the screen.

	FILTER ON (f)
		Opens an editor for filter which will filter rows on completion.
		See Filter Editor.

	FILTER OFF (F)
		Resets to having no filter.

	NEXT PAGE OF ROWS (page-down)
		Goes to next page of entries.

	PREVIOUS PAGE OF ROWS (page-up)
		Goes to previous page of entries.
